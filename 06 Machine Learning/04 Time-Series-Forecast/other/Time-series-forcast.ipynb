    "# What is Time Series Forcasting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series forecasting is a statistical and machine learning technique used to predict future values based on historical data that is ordered over time. This type of data is often collected at regular intervals (e.g., daily, monthly, quarterly) and includes a temporal aspect, making it essential to account for patterns like trends, seasonality, and cyclicality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stationarity:\n",
    "A series is said to be stationary if its statistical properties (mean, variance) are constant over a period of time. Stationarity is essential for many forecasting models, like ARIMA. If a series is non-stationary, it needs to be converted to stationary form before applying such models. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Properties\n",
    "    - Constant Mean\n",
    "    - Constant Variance\n",
    "    - No Seasonality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Seasonality**:\n",
    "Refers to periodic fluctuations in data that occur over a period of less than a year (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly). It captures repetitive patterns/cycles/trends over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check for Stationarity**:\n",
    "- Visual Inspection:\n",
    "    - Plot the time series data to observe trends, seasonality, and variability.\n",
    "    - Stationary series often show constant mean and variance over time.\n",
    "    - Visual inspection can give initial insights but may not be conclusive.\n",
    "- Statistical Tests:\n",
    "    - ADG (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) Test\n",
    "    - KPPS\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key methods to convert non-stationary series to stationary series**:\n",
    "- Differencing: Removing trends by subtracting each observation from the previous one (first-order differencing) or by using seasonal differencing for periodic patterns.\n",
    "- Detrending: Eliminating trends through regression or by subtracting a fitted trend line from the data.\n",
    "- Transformation: Applying mathematical transformations (e.g., logarithm, square root, or Box-Cox) to stabilize the variance across the series.\n",

    "**Autocorrelation**:\n",
    "- Autocorrelation (also called serial correlation) refers to the correlation of a time series with its own past values.\n",
    "- It helps in identifying repeating patterns, such as seasonality in time series data.\n",
    "- The Autocorrelation Function (ACF) is used to measure autocorrelation at different lags.\n",
    "- A high autocorrelation at a certain lag indicates that past values at that lag are highly predictive of future values.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)**:\n",
    "- The PACF is similar to ACF, but it measures the correlation between a time series and its lags after removing the effects of shorter lags.\n",
    "- The PACF helps to identify the appropriate order for Auto-Regressive (AR) models by showing the partial correlation at each lag.\n",
    "- In an AR model, the PACF will typically show significant spikes at the lag order, which helps in selecting the correct number of lags.\n",

    "Key Differences Between ACF and PACF\n",
    "- ACF: Measures the total correlation at each lag, including the indirect effects from all shorter lags.\n",
    "- PACF: Measures the direct correlation at each lag after removing the influence of shorter lags.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an Auto-Regressive (AR) model, we use the Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) to determine the appropriate number of lags to include. This helps us identify the order of the AR model—the number of past values that have a direct influence on the future values.\n"
