    "# t-test\n",
    "\n",
    "A t-test is a statistical hypothesis test used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. It is commonly used when the sample sizes are small, and the population standard deviation is unknown. The t-test helps evaluate if the difference in means is due to chance or represents a real difference.\n",

    "### Types of T-Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "- One-Sample T-Test\n",
    "    - Compares the mean of a single sample to a known value (usually the population mean).\n",
    "- Independent (Two-Sample) T-Test\n",
    "    - Compares the means of two independent or unrelated groups to determine if they are significantly different.\n",
    "- Paired (Dependent) T-Test\n",
    "    - Compares the means of two related groups, typically the same group measured at two different points in time (before and after)."
