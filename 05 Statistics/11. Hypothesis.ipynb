    "   - Example: $H_0: \\mu = \\mu_0$ vs. $H_1: \\mu \\neq \\mu_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Choose Significance Level ($\\alpha$)**: \n",
    "   - The significance level is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (Type I error). It is typically set at 0.05 or 0.01.\n",

    "   - Chi-Square Test: Used for categorical data.\n",

    "      Calculate the test statistic (e.g., t-value, F-value) and then the p-value. The p-value represents the probability of observing the data (or more extreme) given that the null hypothesis is true. It is the probability of getting sample mean outside the confidence interval.\n",
