    "### Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive statistics involve methods and techniques used to summarize and describe important features of data. These statistics are used to present and organize data in a meaningful way, providing insights into its characteristics. Common descriptive statistics include measures of central tendency (like mean, median, mode), measures of variability or dispersion (such as variance, standard deviation, range), and graphical representations (like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots). Descriptive statistics are primarily concerned with summarizing data sets, identifying patterns, and highlighting key features without making inferences beyond the data at hand.\n",

    "- **Measures**: Mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation.\n",
    "- **Graphical Tools**: Histograms, bar charts, pie charts, box plots, scatter plots.\n",
    "- **Software**: Excel, SPSS, R, Python (libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).\n",

    "### Inferential Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics involves making inferences or predictions about a population based on a sample of data taken from that population. It uses probability theory to generalize from a sample to a larger population, drawing conclusions and making predictions or hypotheses. Inferential statistics includes techniques like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). These methods help researchers assess relationships between variables, test hypotheses, and make decisions based on the data.\n",
